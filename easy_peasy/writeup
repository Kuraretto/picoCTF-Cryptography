def not easy peasy

A one-time pad is unbreakable, but can you manage to recover the flag? (Wrap with picoCTF{}) nc mercury.picoctf.net 11188 otp.py

so i download the py script and see the code but could not really understand what it does 

so i tried connecting with the server using the 

nc mercury.picoctf.net 11188

and saw that it printed the encrypted flag 

i had no idea what to ddo so i searched for a writeup 

and once i read the writeup i was able to understand how it works 

the encrypted flag is 5541103a246e415e036c4c5f0e3d415a513e4a560050644859536b4f57003d4c
and the lenght of the flag is 32 bytes and the length of the key is 50000 bytes from the source code 

we can find this in the given code which we downloaded 

the "stop >= KEY_LEN" in source code suggests that if the start position of the key exceeds 50000, it will return to the beginning, and send 32 bytes of \x00 at the second "what data would you like to encrypt?"

once we get this 

it looked familar like an XOR since we are given a key 

so i opened cyber chef and 

converted this
5541103a246e415e036c4c5f0e3d415a513e4a560050644859536b4f57003d4c

using from hex 

and then 

using XOR 

i entered the key 62275c7838335c7866305c786462775c7862355c7865365c7861615a5c786536

and got the output 

7904ff830f1c5bba8f763707247ba3e1

and i put this in the picoCTF flag format and boom
