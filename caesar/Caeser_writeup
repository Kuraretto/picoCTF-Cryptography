very very easy challenege 


first we download the attachement they have provided us a cipher text, the clue is that it is a caeser cipher so 

the first thing that came to my mind is that lets try to decode it using dcode.fr 

and when i used https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher

and give the input encrypted text and then decrypt 

we get the output 

"crossingtherubicondjneoach"

this is the output from the decryption so we put it in the flag format 

picoCTF{crossingtherubicondjneoach}
