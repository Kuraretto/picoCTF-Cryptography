ReadMyCert

Description
How about we take you on an adventure on exploring certificate signing requests Take a look at this CSR file here.

first we check the file tyupe using the file cmd and see that it is a PEM certificate request 

and by reading the contents in the file using the cat command we can see that it starts with 
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST----- 

and end with -----END CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----

to find out in detail about the contents displayed by the cat output we use the tool openssl 

openssl is knowm for its ability to handle various cryptographic operations

we use the command 

openssl req -in readmycert.csr -noout -text

by using this command we can get a more detailed output of the certificate file 

and in this under the title Subject: CN = 

we can see that the flag has been printed 

Here is the detailed view of the command we used to get the flag

    openssl: The command-line tool for cryptographic operations.
    req: A subcommand for working specifically with certificate requests like CSRs.
    -in: Specifies the input file, in this case, our CSR file.
    -noout: Ensures that the actual certificate is not output, focusing on the textual representation.
    -text: Displays the CSR in a human-readable format, showing all relevant details.
