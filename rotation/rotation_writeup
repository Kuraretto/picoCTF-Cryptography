rotation

Description
You will find the flag after decrypting this file

we are given a file to download and once we download the file

the dowloaded file is a simple file with an excrypted text inside 

we copy the text 

"xqkwKBN{z0bib1wv_l3kzgxb3l_429in00n}"

the name of the challenge gave me a very importatn clue abotu what type of encryption this was 

so i went ot cyberchef and pasted the encrypted text and then used the "ROT13"
method to decrypt the text 

and increased the rotation amount to 18 

here it is important to note that the options for 

"Rotate lower case chars" and "Rotate uppeer case chars" are ticked and the "Rotate numbers" is not checked 

when the amount of rotation it set to 18 
the output gives us the flag
