i used the online website 

https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html

and uploaded the given wav file 
and ran the decoder 

it printed out 

WH47 H47H 90D W20U9H7

and when wee take a look at the challenge decription

Description
Morse code is well known. Can you decrypt this? Download the file here. Wrap your answer with picoCTF{}, put underscores in place of pauses, and use all lowercase.

it wanted us to enter the flag in lowercases with the underscore 
so 
this would be the flag content 

wh47_h47h_90d_w20u9h7

then we put this in the picoCTF flag format and enter the flag
