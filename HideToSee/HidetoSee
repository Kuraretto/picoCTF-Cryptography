pretty easy challenge 

the main hint is given in the image name itself saying it is atbash cipher 

the first thing i did was try to extract it using binwalk but i was not able to retrive it 

so i used steghide info atbash.jpg

this showed me 

"atbash.jpg":
  format: jpeg
  capacity: 2.4 KB
Try to get information about embedded data ? (y/n) y
Enter passphrase:
  embedded file "encrypted.txt":
    size: 31.0 Byte
    encrypted: rijndael-128, cbc
    compressed: yes
    
then i extracted the contents using 

steghide extract -sf atbash.jpg

and i got the encrypted.txt file 


i opened it and got the contents and went to dcode website and used the atbash decipher and decrypted the flag
