Vingenere 

very easy challenge the key was also given in the problem itself 

i downloaded the text file and opened it and copied the contents of the file then i went to 

dcode.fr and used the cipher identifier and once i pasted in the encrypted text in the text box and gave analyze it showed that it is either 

Ragbaby
Substitution
shift
Enigma
Homophonic
Vigenere

here i got the clue that it had to be Vigenere as the name of the challenege is literally the same 

so i use Vingenere Cipher and give it the key and gave decrypt 

and boom we got our flag
